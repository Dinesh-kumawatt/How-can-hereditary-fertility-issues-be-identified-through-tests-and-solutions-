Hereditary fertility issues can be identified through advanced genetic testing and a careful review of family history. At Ayuh Fertility Centre, specialists offer comprehensive evaluations including karyotyping, Y-chromosome microdeletion tests, and hormone analysis. These tests detect genetic abnormalities that may affect sperm quality in men or ovarian function in women. For women with recurrent miscarriages or early menopause in the family, genetic screenings provide early clues.

Ayuhâ€™s solution-oriented approach includes offering Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) during IVF, which ensures only genetically healthy embryos are transferred. Genetic counseling is also available to help couples understand the risks and implications of passing on genetic disorders. This thorough, science-based approach empowers patients to make informed decisions.
